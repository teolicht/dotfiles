TODO ---

[ ] - Try to find an alternative to the input_source polling rate, right now it's checking every single second
        - Ideal would be something that detects a change in input_source. But I tried and its not triggering any events I could listen to.

[ ] - Try to find an alternative to the wifi polling rate, right now its constantly pinging apple.com 
        - Sometimes it fails the ping and the wifi becomes red, even though i didn't lose connection
        - Again, ideal would be something that only runs when a lost connection is detected. But I guess the only way to implement this is by having something constantly pinging a website until it fails.

[ ] - Transparent background for the items -> brighter background in the future (maybe bright during the day, dark during the night?)

[ ] - Make AeroSpace workspaces dynamic
        - creating/deleting workspaces in AeroSpace isn't possible. So I could configure Sketchybar to only show workspaces currently have windows open? 
            - But then since I have apps assigned to specific workspaces, at some point the statusbar could be showing something likle [1][3][4] which is a bit weird. But could work. It's actually a nice overview of which workspaces actually have windows.
        - Since I don't like the idea of the workspaces statusbar constantly changing to show which windows are open where, I could instead implement a simple script that makes the workspaces without windows a different color, so I know those workspaces are empty. 

[ ] - Show icon of current app?
